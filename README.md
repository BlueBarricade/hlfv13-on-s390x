# Hyperledger Fabric 1.3 on s309x server

1. Setup and verify of your blockchain environment.
2. Create a blockchain project in Hyperledger Composer.
3. Interact with blockchain and third party APIs through Composer Rest Server and NodeRed.

## Application Overview
This blockchain journey is intended to give you a basic understanding of how a developer would interact with Hyperledger Fabric using Hyperledger Composer. In this workshop you will use a browser based UI to modify chaincode, test your code and deploy your changes. You will also learn how tooling can take the code and generate API to allow for application integration through a REST-ful interface.
